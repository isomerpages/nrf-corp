## Early Stage Venture Fund

The Early Stage Venture Fund (ESVF) is an initiative under the National Framework for Innovation and Enterprise (NFIE)\[1\]. ESVF seeds funds with selected venture capital firms to invest in Singapore-based early-stage technology start-ups.

Under this initiative, the National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore invests S$10 million on a matching basis, to seed corporate venture capital (VC) funds that invest in Singapore-based early stage high-tech companies. As an incentive, the corporate VCs have the option to buy out NRF’s share of the fund within five years by returning NRF’s capital with interest.

### Awarded Venture Capital Funds

In July 2008, the NRF launched the Early Stage Venture Funding Scheme (ESVF) to finance VC funds to provide early stage investment for Singapore-based technology start-ups.

The first batch of five VC funds were:

*   Bioveda Capital
*   [New Asia Investments](http://www.newasiainvestments.com/)
*   [Raffles Venture Partners](http://www.rafflesventurepartners.com/)
*   [Extream Ventures](http://www.extreamventures.com/) 
*   [Walden International](http://www.waldenintl.com/index.aspx)

With a vibrant technology start-up ecosystem taking shape and Singapore seeing encouraging results from its investments, a challenge for start-ups is limited early stage financing in Singapore and the region. To address this funding gap, Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Teo Chee Hean, Chairman of the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, announced on 25 Sep 2013 at Techventure 2013 that the Singapore government would inject S$50 million to energise the early stage investment ecosystem.\[2\]  
  
In April 2014, NRF announced the second batch of VC funds under the ESVF scheme.  
  
The six VC funds are:

*   [Jungle Ventures](http://www.jungle-ventures.com/)
*   [Golden Gate Ventures](http://goldengate.vc/)
*   [Tembusu ICT Fund I](https://www.ictfund.sg/) \[3\]
*   [Walden International](http://www.waldenintl.com/index.aspx)
*   [New Asia Investments](http://www.newasiainvestments.com/)
*   [Monk's Hill Ventures](http://www.monkshill.com/#about)

In 2016, NRF awarded venture capital funds to four large local enterprises (LLEs), under the third instalment of ESVF (ESVFIII), to invest in innovative local tech start-ups. NRF committed S$10 million per fund, on a matching basis, to invest in technology start-ups based in Singapore. This aims to encourage LLEs to engage in corporate venturing to source for innovative technologies and business models as part of their overall corporate strategy, and in the process improve their innovation capacity, This also enables start-ups to scale-up by leveraging on LLEs’ mentorship, resources and networks  

The four LLEs and the focus of their corporate venture capital funds are:
