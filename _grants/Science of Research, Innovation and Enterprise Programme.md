The National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, launched the Science of Research, Innovation and Enterprise (SRIE) programme in 2014 to support evidence-based policy-making in research, innovation and enterprise. 

### SRIE 1st Grant Call
---
The first NRF SRIE grant call was made on 14 July 2014. Seventeen proposal submissions were received from Singapore-based researchers from local universities when the call closed on 25 August 2014. Proposals were subjected to a two-stage international peer evaluation and selection process, and six projects were finally selected for award in December 2014.  

### Synopses of Awarded SRIE Projects
---
The six awarded projects are:

1. Growth Dynamics of High-Tech Start-Ups in Singapore – A Longitudinal Study
2. Technology Upgrading Policy for SMEs: A Study of Singapore’s Pioneering GET-Up Programme
3. Understanding Innovation in Small Medium Enterprises and Start-Ups
4. Altmetrics: Rethinking and Exploring New Ways of Measuring Research
5. Singapore in the Global Talent Race

#### 1. Growth Dynamics of High-Tech Start-Ups in Singapore – A Longitudinal Study

Lead Principal Investigator: Prof Wong Poh Kam  
Institute: National University of Singapore

This study seeks to gain insights on the key growth drivers of high-tech start-ups (HTSUs) as well as the macro impacts of HTSUs on Singapore’s economy over the last 10 years, and to provide empirical evidence for policy recommendations for the next 5 to 10 years.   
  
There are three parts to this study. The first two parts identify the key growth drivers of HTSUs at different stages of the start-up cycle (2005-2009 and 2010-2014) and how these drivers vary with changes in Singapore’s entrepreneurship ecosystem, based on survey of young technology firms started in the two five year periods. The third part provides a macro comparative analysis of the dynamism and employment contribution of HTSUs in Singapore versus selected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.  
  
The research methodology and five-yearly survey datasets will provide a foundation for future studies to track the growth performance and micro-drivers of HTSUs in Singapore. Tracking of growth performance will be based on five-year intervals, or on an annual basis, while the macro analysis can be conducted yearly.

Lead Principal Investigator: Prof Hang Chang Chieh  
Institute: National University of Singapore

Singapore's “Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrading” (GET-Up) seeks to stimulate technology transfer from public to private sector to promote the R&D capability of the Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). This study attempts to understand the effectiveness of the technology transfer between the Research Institutes (RIs) and SMEs. It will examine how GET-Up has helped to enhance the R&D capability, resource availability and performance of SMEs. It will also look at factors influencing the effectiveness of the technology transfer and benefits attained by the research institutes with respect to the source and the recipient, technology, transfer agent, environment and business models of SMEs, etc.  
  
Qualitative and quantitative methods through large scale surveys with the SMEs, research scientists, engineers, policy makers, as well as statistical methods will be deployed to analyse the data.  
  
The results will be shared with the public agencies in the GET-Up schemes such as A\*STAR, EDB, SPRING, IES, Polytechnics, etc., to enhance its translational R&D programmes and will also be shared with SMEs so that they are better prepared for a successful transfer of technology and knowledge from RIs.

#### 3. Understanding Innovation in Small Medium Enterprises and Start-Ups

Lead Principal Investigator: Prof Boh Wai Fong  
Institute: Nanyang Technological University

Building on research in the behavioural economics, cognitive science and social psychology domains, this study seeks to identify and examine the decision-making styles and preferences of entrepreneurs and how these act as enablers or barriers to innovation, which in turn affect the innovation and performance of the firm.   
  
The study also seeks to identify the key strategies that entrepreneurs adopt to improve innovation and the manner in which the decision-making styles and preference of entrepreneurs “diffuse to” and interact with the strategies adopted by entrepreneurs towards innovation and growth. Understanding this connection is a significant theoretical and applied contribution as it uncovers the mechanisms through which decision-making preferences of entrepreneurs influence outcomes such as innovation, growth and performance of the firm.  
  
Findings, which are to be shared with government agencies, key partners (e.g. SPRING), study respondents, SMEs and start-ups, will provide insights into the following issues: 

*   Profiles of decision-making preferences of successful versus unsuccessful entrepreneurs;
*   Best practices, innovation processes and key strategies adopted by successful versus unsuccessful entrepreneurs and local companies;
*   Drivers of innovation in SMEs and start-ups;
*   Barriers of innovation and how successful entrepreneurs overcome those barriers;
*   Impact of government programmes and incentives and recommendations with respect to the appropriate timeframe and features of policy interventions.
