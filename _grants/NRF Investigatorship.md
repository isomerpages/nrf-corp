## NRF Investigatorship

NRF aims to develop a strong science research and manpower base in Singapore. It runs initiatives to attract and retain top scientists, support competitive funding of research, establish world-leading research centres and engage eminent science and technology leaders.

The NRF Investigatorship provides opportunities for scientists and researchers to pursue ground-breaking, high-risk research. It is designed to support a small number of excellent Principal Investigators who have a track record of research achievements that identify them as leaders in their respective field(s) of research.
