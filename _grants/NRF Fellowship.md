NRF aims to develop a strong science research and manpower base in Singapore. It runs initiatives to attract and retain top scientists, support competitive funding of research, establish world-leading research centres and engage eminent science and technology leaders.

The Singapore NRF Fellowship provides opportunities for early career researchers to carry out independent research in Singapore, over a five-year period. It is open to all areas of science and technology and outstanding young scientists and researchers of all nationalities are welcome to apply.

Each Fellow is provided with a research grant to support projects that exhibit high likelihood of a research breakthrough. The research grant can be used to cover personnel, equipment and consumables costs.
