The National Research Foundation Competitive Research Programme funding scheme seeks to foster the formation of multi-disciplinary teams to conduct cutting-edge research projects that are of relevance to Singapore and the society.    
  
The Competitive Research Programme funds use-inspired basic research projects that are selected  through a merit review process based on scientific excellence. The theme of the proposed research project must be motivated by an important need or problem to be solved.
