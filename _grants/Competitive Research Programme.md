<p>The National Research Foundation Competitive Research Programme (CRP)
funding scheme seeks to foster the formation of multi-disciplinary teams
to conduct cutting-edge research projects that are of relevance to Singapore
and society.</p>
<p>The CRP funds use-inspired basic research projects selected through a
merit review process based on scientific excellence. The theme of the proposed
research project must be motivated by an important need or problem to be
solved.</p>
<p>Past projects have made discoveries of potentially significant impact
on industry and society. Click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/crp-30thcall" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to view these projects.</p>
<p>The next CRP Grant Call will resume in Mar 2024. Please check the <a href="https://www.researchgrant.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Integrated Grant Management System (IGMS)</a> website
regularly for updates on the launch dates of the CRP Categories.</p>
