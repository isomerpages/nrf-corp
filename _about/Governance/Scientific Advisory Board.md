The **Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)** is a multi-disciplinary international board with expertise in broad areas of technology. The SAB convenes annually in Singapore to advise on NRF’s policies and programmes.

The SAB’s role is to:
* Highlight critical issues and emerging global trends in basic and investigator-led research where Singapore could fill a gap or meet a need;
* Identify, with the NRF, new areas of research where Singapore can reap the benefits of cutting edge science and build the foundation for enterprise and industry growth;
* Review and advise on the proposals and plans prepared by the NRF; and
* Assist and advise the NRF on the management of R&amp;D, including the allocation of funding and the assessment of research outcomes.

SAB members are appointed by the Chairman of the NRF Board. The SAB is chaired by Professor Dame Lynn Gladden, Shell Professor of Chemical Engineering, University of Cambridge.
