The Singapore Battery Consortium aims to promote the deployment of new battery technologies and products. By bringing together researchers, companies, and the public sector, the consortium will help companies access battery-related research for translation into novel products serve market needs. It is hosted at A\*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), and supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF), with $2 million set aside over three years.  
  
Over the past decade, commercial interest in battery development has been on the rise, keeping pace with demand for better battery performance and different performance characteristics for increasingly complex mobility and portable devices. To meet this demand, the Singapore Battery Consortium will bring research outcomes from our laboratories into market by enabling researchers to understand business requirements, while giving companies access to the latest battery research and technologies to augment their product development efforts.

In addition to regular networking sessions, workshops, seminars and symposia, members can look forward to sharing sessions by international experts. The consortium will partner Singapore-anchored companies of all types – startups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large local enterprises (LLEs), and multi-national companies (MNCs) – for this effort.

The founding industry members of the consortium are LiRON, Durapower, Orient Tech and Genplus. These are local companies in battery materials production, battery cell manufacturing, and battery pack design and production.  
  
**Focus Areas**

*   Battery materials synthesis, which looks into new materials and processes for batteries with better performance.

*   Cell and module production, which examines the prototyping, testing, and manufacturing of new designs for battery cells and modules using new processes.

*   Battery management systems, which includes thermal cooling strategies, wireless charging design, and fast charging methodology.

*   Battery recycling, which seeks to develop innovative technologies to improve recycling related to batteries, such as making it easier for precious metals to be recovered to manufacture new batteries.

**Governance**

The Singapore Battery Consortium will be led by Professor Gregory Goh from A\*STAR, who will chart the directions of the consortium and supervise its operations. He will be supported by a Technical Committee which will comprise experts from Institutes of Higher Learning and A\*STAR research institutes. A steering committee comprised of representatives from NRF, A\*STAR, Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will provide strategic and financial oversight.
