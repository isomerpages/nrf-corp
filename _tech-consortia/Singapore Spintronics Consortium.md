## Singapore Spintronics Consortium ##

The Singapore Spintronics Consortium (SG-SPIN) aims to encourage researchers to explore innovations in electron spin-based technologies for sensor, memory and logic applications. It will facilitate research collaborations between Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and industry, and attract companies to conduct spintronics activities in Singapore.

The founding members of SG-SPIN are the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Applied Materials, Inc., Delta Electronics and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed on 5 December 2014 between these five organisations, whereby they agreed to cooperate and collaborate in spintronics R&amp;D activities.

SG-SPIN is led by Professor Wu Yihong from NUS Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and supported by NRF and NTUâ€™s NTUitive. The NUS Industry Liaison Office, which is part of NUS Enterprise, took the lead in driving and facilitating this collaboration.

In April 2015, NRF announced a new fund of S$5 million to support industry collaborations with Institutes of Higher Learning in developing new applications through spintronics research. Building on the $39 million for on-going research work by SG-SPIN members, the new funds will help to bridge the gap from research to industry application and grow the spintronics ecosystem in Singapore.
