The [Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC)](http://sdsc.sg/) was set up to deepen Singaporeâ€™s existing strengths in data science and analytics. SDSC will strengthen collaborative research linkages between Institutes of Higher Learning, research institutes and industry in data science R&D, with the aim of facilitating industry adoption of the latest cutting-edge data science and analytics technologies to address real-world challenges. It will also train our local pipeline of talents with deep data science capabilities.
 
SDSC was set up by the National Research Foundation Singapore, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Nanyang Technological University, the Singapore Management University and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research. SDSC will work in partnership with the Economic Development Board and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to engage companies in six economic sectors, namely: finance; healthcare; customer and retail; manufacturing; logistics; and transport. It will put particular emphasis on engaging local enterprises including large local enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups.
 
The consortium will be led by Professor Ho Teck Hua, Deputy President (Research & Technology) and Tan Chin Tuan Centennial Professor at NUS. It will help the industry to identify and shape their data science problem statements, match companies to the relevant potential R&D partners, and conduct industry engagement events and workshops to allow companies to understand the possibilities that data science and data analytics can bring to their business and operations, thereby facilitating adoption and commercialisation of these technologies by our companies. 
 
Through the consortium, companies will be able to tap on data science expertise residing in our Institutes of Higher Learning and research institutes, access publicly-funded intellectual property to develop new products and services, or create solutions to existing market challenges.
