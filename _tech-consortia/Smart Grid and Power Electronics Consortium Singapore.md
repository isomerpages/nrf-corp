Singapore has invested steadily in research in smart grid technologies in the past decade. These investments have grown a strong base of researchers with expertise in the smart grid and power electronics domain. The [Smart Grid and Power Electronics Consortium Singapore (SPECS)](https://www.specs.com.sg/) is set up to provide a platform for companies to access the latest technologies developed by these researchers, and to translate them into commercially-viable products and services.

It will enable companies to work with publicly-funded researchers to translate intellectual property around Energy Grid 2.0 technologies into solutions for deployment and commercialisation. The consortium will focus on areas in advanced power electronics such as solid state transformers, energy management systems such as load and generation balancing, and cybersecurity. Technologies in these areas will help to achieve energy savings, and support a smarter grid system that is secure and resilient.

SPECS is a national consortium that will be hosted at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore). The management board will be co-chaired by the Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N) and Energy Market Authority to facilitate the eventual deployment of smart grid and power electronics technologies developed in the Energy Grid 2.0 programme.

17 companies have joined the consortium, including AMETEK Programmable Power Inc, EPI Technology Venture Pte Ltd, IESVE Singapore Pte Ltd, Interwell Pte Ltd, Lite Unite Pte Ltd, Sembcorp Industries Ltd and TransferFi Pte Ltd. Read press release for the full list of companies.
