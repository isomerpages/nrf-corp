The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) is a multi-disciplinary international board with expertise in broad areas of technology. The SAB convenes annually in Singapore to advise on NRF’s policies and programmes.

The SAB’s role is to:
* Highlight critical issues and emerging global trends in basic and investigator-led research where Singapore could fill a gap or meet a need;
* Identify, with the NRF, new areas of research where Singapore can reap the benefits of cutting edge science and build the foundation for enterprise and industry growth;
* Review and advise on the proposals and plans prepared by the NRF; and
* Assist and advise the NRF on the management of R&amp;D, including the allocation of funding and the assessment of research outcomes.

SAB members are appointed by the Chairman of the [NRF Board](/about/governance/nrfb/). The SAB is chaired by Sir Richard Friend, Cavendish Professor of Physics, University of Cambridge.
