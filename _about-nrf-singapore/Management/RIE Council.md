The NRF supports the Research Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC).  
  
The RIEC is chaired by the Prime Minister of Singapore, who appoints members to two-year terms. The RIEC comprises Cabinet Ministers and distinguished local and foreign members from the business, science and technology communities.  
  
Set up in 2006, the RIEC provides strategic direction for national R&D. It has two main goals:  
  

*   To advise the Cabinet on national research and innovation strategies to drive the transformation of Singapore into a knowledge-based society, with strong capabilities in research, innovation and enterprise to meet our economic and societal needs; and

*   To lead Singaporeâ€™s commitment towards research, innovation and enterprise by strengthening enterprise innovation capabilities and accelerating technology translation, with a view to catalyse value capture in key strategic areas for Singapore.

This high-level council underscores the political commitment to and importance placed on the national R&D agenda.
