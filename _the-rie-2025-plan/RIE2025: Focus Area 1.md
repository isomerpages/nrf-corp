### ****Expand RIE mission to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs****

In RIE2025, we will build on our RIE capabilities to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs, enhance Singapore’s competitive advantage in the long-term, and anchor our position as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.  RIE investments will be integrated tightly with national initiatives, such as the work of the Future Economy Council to drive economic growth and industry transformation, and our Smart Nation efforts to build a digital future for Singapore.
