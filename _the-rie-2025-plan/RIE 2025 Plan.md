Science and technology (S&T) is instrumental to Singapore’s survival and success, and has helped us to overcome the constraints of our small size and limited resources.

Singapore’s R&D journey started in 1991, with the establishment of the National Science and Technology Board, and the launch of the first five-year National Technology Plan. The aim was to develop high-technology activities that would move us up the economic value chain and build a strong base of scientists, engineers and technologists who would help to drive economic and enterprise transformation. These plans would be refreshed every five years to position Singapore as an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy.

In 2010, Singapore’s R&D strategy was expanded to span Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE). The RIE2015 and RIE2020 plans included translation, commercialisation and innovation strategies to tap on the growing pipeline of promising research outputs and support our enterprises.

Given the rapidly evolving global and technology landscape, RIE plans have also evolved to include White Space funding for unanticipated needs and opportunities. This has enabled Singapore to respond nimbly to new priorities, and to seed capabilities in critical, but then-nascent technology areas such as cybersecurity and food.

### **Deep research excellence**

Steady and sustained investment in R&D is a key pillar of Singapore’s economic development strategy.

We have built up a rich and diverse research ecosystem. Our Institutes of Higher Learning, Research Institutes in the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), academic medical centres and hospitals are well-regarded for their research excellence. The Campus of Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) has established strong international partnerships between local research performers and their international counterparts.

We have developed world-class research infrastructure and facilities to strengthen the RIE ecosystem, including the St John’s Island National Marine Laboratory, and the National Supercomputing Centre. Our researchers have also grown internationally-competitive capabilities in areas such as quantum technologies, glaucoma and retinal vessel research, 2D materials, and photonics. These have not only enabled new capabilities in adjacent technology domains, but also continue to attract local and global talent to work on emerging areas of science here. Since 1998, the number of researchers per 1,000 labour force has doubled, raising our national capacity for innovation across academia, industry, and government.

Over the years, we have seen a steady rise in the overall level of research quality in Singapore. The proportion of Singapore’s publications amongst the world’s most highly cited has grown steadily over the past 20 years. By 2013, Singapore had caught up with other Small Advanced Economies such as Switzerland and the Netherlands; and we have remained amongst the best over the past five years - 19% of our publications are in the top 10% most highly-cited publications worldwide.

### **Vibrant and dynamic I&E ecosystem**

Singapore has a vibrant and dynamic I&E ecosystem. Since 2014, Singapore has maintained its position as the top innovative nation in Asia Pacific on the Global Innovation Index, an annual ranking of 130 economies compiled by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, Cornell University and INSEAD. Private sector R&D activity has increased steadily over the last two decades, with annual business expenditure on R&D growing from $1.5B in 1998 to $5.6B in 2018.

Global companies have invested strongly in Singapore, creating vibrant industry clusters, enabling knowledge transfer to local enterprises, and creating good jobs for Singaporeans. 80 of the world’s top 100 technology companies have established a presence here, including Google and Facebook.

RIE remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s development into a knowledge-based, innovation-driven economy and society. It is a key enabler in creating new avenues of growth and raising Singapore’s economic competitiveness. It also generates scientific breakthroughs that meet our societal needs and improve the lives of Singaporeans.  

We have evolved our RIE strategies to respond to new technological and societal driving forces. We will invest in a focused manner in strategic areas of national relevance, to address our national needs, prepare us for future challenges, and generate new opportunities for growth. These will help us, as a nation, to stay one step ahead of issues such as accelerating digitalisation, evolving global trade flows, and growing emphasis on climate change and sustainability. COVID-19 has also brought about unprecedented disruption to economies and societies. For example, over 75% of global manufacturing operations have been affected. But there are opportunities and hope – and Singapore is well-positioned to help our enterprises respond and emerge stronger.

Talent development continues to underpin our RIE efforts. We will continue to build up our local base of scientists, engineers and technologists, while remaining open to international talent, to create global impact.

For RIE2025, we will emphasise three strategic focus areas to build on the progress achieved in the past RIE plans to create greater value from our RIE investments.

*  Focus Area 1: Expand RIE mission to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs
*  Focus Area 2: Enrich our scientific base
*  Focus Area 3: Scale up platforms to drive technology 
translation and strengthen the innovation 
capabilities of our enterprises

### RIE2025 Budget ###

The government will sustain investments in research, innovation and enterprise at about 1% of Singapore's GDP over 2021-2025 for RIE2025. This is about $25B, and reflects the Singapore government’s sustained, long-term commitment to R&D through economic cycles.
