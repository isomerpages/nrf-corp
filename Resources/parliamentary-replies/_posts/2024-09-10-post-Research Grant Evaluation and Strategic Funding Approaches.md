<h4>Date: For Parliament Sitting on 10 September 2024</h4>
<h4><strong>Title: "Administration and Evaluation of National Research Foundation Grants, and Consideration of ARPA-like Models in Singapore"</strong></h4>
<h4>MPs Speaking: Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Heng Swee Keat</h4>
<p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru</strong>&nbsp;asked the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance (a) what percentage of National Research Foundation (NRF) research
grants are awarded through grant calls administered directly by NRF instead
of through statutory boards; (b) for statutory board-administered grant
calls, what percentage of evaluators have significant relevant research
experience; and (c) why has an ARPA-like model, where expert programme
managers autonomously set strategic research directions and funding, not
been adopted.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat (for the Prime Minister):&nbsp;</strong>Singapore’s
Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) investments involve close collaboration
among the National Research Foundation (NRF), Government agencies and RIE
ecosystem stakeholders. These investments include RIE programmes supported
by the National Research Fund, that are administered by NRF and other Government
agencies. As at end-FY2023, around 50% of RIE2025 National Research Fund
grants are directly administered by NRF.</p>
<p>Government agencies evaluate research grant applications based on the
respective RIE programme’s approved eligibility and evaluation criteria.
The evaluation processes for technical proposals generally incorporate
reviews by experts in the relevant field, such as international peer reviewers
or technical evaluation panel members, to support Government agencies’
funding decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NRF regularly reviews RIE grant administration modalities, including studying
overseas models such as the Advanced Research Projects Agencies (ARPA).
ARPA-like models require a strong cadre of expert programme managers and
leadership driving the programmes towards specific goals that are often
higher-risk or ambitious in nature. We will continue to review where such
models are appropriate in Singapore’s context, and deploy such models if
useful.</p>
