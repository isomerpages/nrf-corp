<h4>Date: For Parliament Sitting on 15 February 2022</h4>
<h4><strong>Title: Goals and Priorities Set under Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan</strong></h4>
<h4>MPs Speaking: Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song, Mr Heng Swee Keat</h4>
<p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Prime Minister&nbsp;with
regard to the recent experimental developments in fusion and the Government's
previously stated aims to look into nuclear fusion as a source of electricity
generation (a) whether the National Research Foundation is looking to participate
in any international fusion reactor projects, like the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER), to allow Singaporean researchers direct access
to the data and latest developments in the field; and (b) if so, what projects
have been looked into and how much funding is being provided.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;The
National Research Foundation is not currently participating in any international
fusion reactor projects. Nonetheless, as part of our overall efforts of
keeping abreast with the latest progress in nuclear technologies, we are
monitoring global developments related to fusion, including at the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), to identify where Singapore
can participate and contribute meaningfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest development, in which researchers produced for the first time
a small fusion reaction that generates more energy than it consumes, is
a significant scientific advancement. However, more work needs to be done
to achieve a much higher scale of net energy gain over a sustained period,
for fusion to generate electricity in a commercially viable manner.</p>
<p>We will continue with our efforts to better understand the evolving nuclear
science and technology by supporting research in relevant areas of nuclear
science and engineering, and training a pool of scientists and experts
through education programmes and collaborations with overseas nuclear technology
partners.</p>
