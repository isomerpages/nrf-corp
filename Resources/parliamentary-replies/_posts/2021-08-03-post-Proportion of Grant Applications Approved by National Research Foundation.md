<h4>Date: For Parliament Sitting on 3 August 2021</h4>
<h4><strong>Title: Proportion of Grant Applications Approved by National Research Foundation with Unanimous Agreement by Review Panelists over Past Three Years</strong></h4>
<h4>MPs Speaking: Dr Tan Wu Meng,Mr Heng Swee Keat</h4>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister
with regard to grant applications considered by the National Research Foundation
and its subsidiary entities over the past three years, how many and what
proportion of grants have been approved with unanimous agreement by the
review panellists.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE: Mr Heng Swee Keat (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;Under
the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) plan, grants are provided
by the National Research Foundation (NRF) and other Government agencies
to strengthen Singapore’s research and scientific capabilities.&nbsp;Panels
of independent experts – both international and local – are typically convened
to review such grant applications, with multiple panels convened for larger
grant awards for added robustness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the review process, the experts are encouraged to engage in
frank and thorough debate on all grant applications.&nbsp;As the experts
assess applications using their specialist knowledge, they may differ in
their assessments. When this occurs, the experts will discuss their assessments
with each other. NRF does not require the experts to be unanimous before
awarding funding. Hence, NRF does not track the number or proportion of
grants approved unanimously by the experts.</p>
<p>NRF’s robust governance of grant applications is reflected in the Competitive
Research Programme (CRP). The CRP funds multi-disciplinary teams to perform
cutting-edge research that is relevant to Singapore. Over the past three
years, NRF has received 412 CRP applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRP applications first pass through the Whitepaper Stage, where panels
of multi-disciplinary international experts shortlist applications for
development into full proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sixteen percent of CRP applications over the past three years were shortlisted.
This reflects the selectivity of NRF’s review process.</p>
<p>Shortlisted CRP applications are then sent to subject-matter experts for
peer review. The Principal Investigators (PIs) who lead the research teams
are invited to respond to the peer reviews. Finally, a separate International
Evaluation Panel considers each shortlisted CRP application alongside the
peer reviews and PIs’ responses. Sixty-one percent of shortlisted CRP applications
over the past three years received NRF funding.</p>
