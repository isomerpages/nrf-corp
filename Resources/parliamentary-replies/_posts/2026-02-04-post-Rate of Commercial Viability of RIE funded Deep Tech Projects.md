<h4>Date: For Parliament Sitting on 4 February 2026</h4>
<h4><strong>Title: Rate of Commercial Viability of RIE-funded Deep Tech Projects and Implementing Outcome-linked Grant Funding Models</strong></h4>
<h4>MPs Speaking: Mr Kenneth Tiong Boon Kiat, Mr Gan Kim Yong</h4>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Mr Kenneth Tiong Boon Kiat</strong>&nbsp;asked the Prime
Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what proportion of Research, Innovation
and Enterprise (RIE) funded deep tech projects achieve commercial viability;
(b) whether the Ministry has studied Israel's model where innovation grants
are repaid only upon commercialisation success; and (c) whether RIE2030
will introduce similar outcome-linked funding mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE: Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Investing in deep tech is a complex endeavour that takes years. There
is no single or simple metric of commercial viability that applies. The
Government uses a range of indicators for RIE-funded projects such as Intellectual
Property (IP) licensing, capability and knowledge building, growing start-ups,
and catalysing private sector investment. For example, in RIE2025, of the
Corporate Laboratories that support partnerships between public researchers
and companies to co-develop technologies for industry, about 80% are expected
to generate licensing revenue from jointly-created IP.</p>
<p>Singapore keeps abreast of good practices in deep tech commercialisation
from other countries, including Israel. The objectives behind our support
schemes and mechanisms for deep tech commercialisation have broad similarities
to those of other countries, but the governance and funding structures
have been adapted to meet the needs of our RIE ecosystem.</p>
<p>We capture value from RIE through various means, including licensing revenue
generated when commercial partners license IP from research institutions,
or returns from equity stakes when startups built around these technologies
achieve commercial success. In addition, research collaborations with both
global and local industry partners help anchor them in Singapore, thereby
contributing to a more dynamic and competitive economy.</p>
