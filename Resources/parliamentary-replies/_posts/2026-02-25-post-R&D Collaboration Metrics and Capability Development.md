<h4>Date: For Parliament Sitting on or after 25 February 2026</h4>
<h4><strong>Title: R&amp;D Collaboration Metrics and Capability Development</strong></h4>
<h4>MPs Speaking: Mr Kenneth Tiong Boon Kiat, Mr Gan Kim Yong</h4>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Mr Kenneth Tiong Boon Kiat </strong>asked the Prime
Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what metrics does the Government
use to measure success of collaborations between national R&amp;D institutions
and private sector partners; (b) how the Government differentiates success
as a 'project manager' coordinating vendors versus a 'knowledge leader'
developing in-house capability; and (c) what steps prevent hollowing-out
of Singapore-based expertise in the national R&amp;D institutions due to
over-reliance on subcontracting.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE: Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>&nbsp;The
Autonomous Universities, A*STAR and other public research institutes collaborate
with private sector partners to conduct industry-relevant research and
development, and to commercialise inventions and technologies from publicly-funded
research. Through these collaborations, our institutions build up capabilities
and know-how while meeting industry needs. At the same time, they contribute
to the economy and strengthen our Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE)
ecosystem.</p>
<p>Beyond capacity and knowledge building, the Government also tracks various
indicators to measure the success of these partnerships, including Intellectual
Property (IP) licensing, development of innovative products and services,
and formation of new startups.</p>
<p>These collaborations between national research institutions and the private
sector have been mutually beneficial. Our researchers are able to commercialise
their intellectual property with companies, developing innovative products
and services that help the companies stay globally competitive. This in
turn spurs increased private sector research and development investments
in Singapore and the creation of new high-value jobs, and further strengthens
Singapore's RIE ecosystem.</p>
