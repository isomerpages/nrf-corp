The **President’s Science &amp; Technology Awards (PSTA)** are the country’s top honours for research scientists and engineers in Singapore. Given annually, the PSTA recognises individuals and teams that have made exceptional contributions in pushing the boundaries of the science and technology (S&amp;T) landscape in Singapore.

Organised by NRF Singapore, there are three distinct awards – the President’s Science &amp; Technology Medal, the President’s Science Award, and the President’s Technology Award. The PSTA also celebrates the Young Scientist Award. The Young Scientist Award is administered by the Singapore National Academy of Science (SNAS) and supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF).

As the highest accolade, the PSTA brand carries prestige, and influence, and most importantly, inspires the next generation. PSTA winners create orbits of impact through their exceptional work, personal ingenuity, and continued search for excellence; they are role models for their peers and aspiring researchers in the science and tech fields.
