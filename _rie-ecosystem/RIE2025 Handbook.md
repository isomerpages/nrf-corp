**Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE)** remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s development into a knowledge-based, innovation-driven economy and society. It is a key enabler in creating new avenues of growth and raising Singapore’s economic competitiveness. It also generates scientific breakthroughs that meet our societal needs and improve the lives of Singaporeans. RIE2025 emphasises three strategic focus areas to build on the progress achieved in the past RIE plans to create greater value from RIE investments:

  *  Expanding RIE mission to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs
  *  Enriching our scientific base
  *  Scaling up platforms to drive technology translation and strengthen the innovation capabilities of our enterprises
