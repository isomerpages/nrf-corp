### Science & Technology ###

Science and technology (S&T) is instrumental to Singapore’s survival and success, and has helped us to overcome the constraints of our small size and limited resources.

Singapore’s R&D journey started in 1991, with the establishment of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), and the launch of the first five-year National Technology Plan. The aim was to develop high-technology activities that would move us up the economic value chain and build a strong base of scientists, engineers and technologists who would help to drive economic and enterprise transformation. These plans would be refreshed every five years to position Singapore as an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy.

The NSTB was restructured as the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in January 2002, and the National Research Foundation was established on 3 Jan 2006. It supports the Research Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) and oversees the announcement of the five-year plans.

### Research, Innovation & Enterprise ###

In 2010, Singapore’s R&D strategy was expanded to span Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) to nurture a vibrant RIE ecosystem comprising of academia, public agencies and industry. The five-year RIE2015 and RIE2020 plans were announced in 2010 and 2015 respectively. The plans included translation, commercialisation and innovation strategies to tap on the growing pipeline of promising research outputs and support our enterprises.

Given the rapidly evolving global and technology landscape, RIE plans have also evolved to include White Space funding for unanticipated needs and opportunities. This has enabled Singapore to respond nimbly to new priorities, and to seed capabilities in critical, but then-nascent technology areas such as cybersecurity and food.

### The RIE2025 Plan ###

RIE remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s development into a knowledge-based, innovation-driven economy and society. It is a key enabler in creating new avenues of growth and raising Singapore’s economic competitiveness. It also generates scientific breakthroughs that meet our societal needs and improve the lives of Singaporeans.

We have evolved our RIE strategies to respond to new technological and societal driving forces. We will invest in a focused manner in strategic areas of national relevance, to address our national needs, prepare us for future challenges, and generate new opportunities for growth. 

These will help us, as a nation, to stay one step ahead of issues such as accelerating digitalisation, evolving global trade flows, and growing emphasis on climate change and sustainability. COVID-19 has also brought about unprecedented disruption to economies and societies.

Talent development continues to underpin our RIE efforts. We will continue to build up our local base of scientists, engineers and technologists, while remaining open to international talent, to create global impact.

Hence, the RIE2025 plan emphasises three strategic focus areas to build on the progress achieved in the past RIE plans to create greater value from our RIE investments:

1. Expand RIE mission to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs
2. Enrich our scientific base
3. Scale up platforms to drive technology translation and strengthen the innovation capabilities of our enterprises

### RIE2025 Strategic Domains at a Glance ###

Our RIE2025 efforts will be organised along four strategic domains, supported by three cross-cutting horizontals.

The Singapore government will sustain investments in research, innovation and enterprise at about 1% of Singapore's GDP over 2021-2025 for RIE2025. This is about $25B, and reflects the Singapore government’s sustained, long-term commitment to R&D through economic cycles.
