<h2>Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Plan 2030</h2>
<p>The <strong>RIE2030 plan</strong> is a five-year strategy that will strengthen
Singapore’s overall competitiveness and societal resilience, and put the
nation in a stronger position to address the challenges and opportunities
in the current volatile global landscape.</p>
<p>RIE2030 will be steered by coordinated efforts in data, artificial intelligence
(AI), and compute capabilities, and anchored on keeping our basic research
and talent at the cutting edge. The five-year strategic plan is designed
to create stronger economic impact in a targeted way; address strategic
national priorities through bold large-scale research programmes; and continue
to drive strong innovation-led growth, thus bolstering Singapore’s position
as a global innovation hub.</p>
