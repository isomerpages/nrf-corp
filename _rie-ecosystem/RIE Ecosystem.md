### Our “Research, Innovation and Enterprise” journey​ ###

SSingapore’s R&D journey started in 1991, with the establishment of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), and the launch of the first five-year National Technology Plan. The aim was to develop advanced technological capabilities for moving Singapore up the economic value chain, with a strong base of scientists, engineers and technologists who could help to drive economic and enterprise transformation. These plans were refreshed every five years and aimed to support Singapore in becoming an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy.

In 2010, Singapore’s R&D strategy was expanded to include “Innovation and Enterprise”, with the vision of growing a “research-intensive, innovative and entrepreneurial economy”. This reflected a growing emphasis on translation, commercialisation and innovation strategies that tap on the growing pipeline of promising research outputs and support our enterprises. The first RIE plan (“RIE2015”) was announced in 2010, and successive 5-year RIE plans have continued to be rolled out since.

Given the rapidly evolving global and technology landscape, the RIE plans have also set aside White Space funding for addressing unanticipated needs and opportunities that arise after the launch of each plan.

### The RIE2025 Plan ###

Today, RIE remains a cornerstone in Singapore’s development into a knowledge-based, innovation-driven economy and society. It is a key enabler of Singapore’s economic competitiveness, and generates new avenues of growth. It has also generated scientific breakthroughs that meet our national needs and improve the lives of Singaporeans.

In RIE2025, the Singapore government will sustain investments in research, innovation and enterprise at about 1% of Singapore's GDP over 2021-2025 ($25B). This reflects the Singapore government’s sustained, long-term commitment to R&D through economic cycles. In developing the RIE2025 plan, we identified three key strategic focuses:

1. Expand RIE mission to tackle a broader spectrum of national needs
2. Enrich our scientific base
3. Scale up platforms to drive technology translation and strengthen the innovation capabilities of our enterprises

Our RIE2025 efforts will be organised along four strategic domains, supported by three cross-cutting horizontals.
