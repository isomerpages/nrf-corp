<h3>Our “Research, Innovation and Enterprise” journey​</h3>
<p>Singapore’s R&amp;D journey started in 1991, with the establishment of
the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), and the launch of the
first five-year National Technology Plan. The aim was to develop advanced
technological capabilities for moving Singapore up the economic value chain,
with a strong base of scientists, engineers and technologists who could
help to drive economic and enterprise transformation. These plans were
refreshed every five years and aimed to support Singapore in becoming an
innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>In 2010, Singapore’s R&amp;D strategy was expanded to include “Innovation
and Enterprise”, with the vision of growing a research-intensive, innovative
and entrepreneurial economy. This reflected a growing emphasis on translation,
commercialisation and innovation strategies that tap on the growing pipeline
of promising research outputs and support our enterprises.</p>

<p>The first RIE plan (“RIE2015”) was announced in 2010, and successive 5-year
RIE plans have continued to be rolled out since. Given the rapidly evolving
global and technology landscape, the RIE plans have also set aside White
Space funding for addressing unanticipated needs and opportunities that
arise after the launch of each plan.</p>
